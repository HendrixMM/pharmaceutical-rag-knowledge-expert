## 📈 Executive Summary  
- **Problem**: Accurate and up-to-date information is critical in every domain—from pharmaceuticals to finance—but teams still rely on manual research across disconnected sources.  
- **Context**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is now standard across industries, yet most implementations are closed, proprietary, and difficult to adapt.  
- **Solution**: This project offers an **open-source, enterprise-ready RAG template** that organizations can easily customize with their own data, APIs, and compliance rules.  
- **Scale**: Handle thousands of documents and live data streams with domain-specific optimization.  
- **Compliance**: Built-in guardrails for regulatory and cultural alignment.  
- **Impact**: Turn hours of research into minutes of analysis with transparent source traceability and audit confidence.

## 🏢 Business Problem  
Every industry depends on accurate, timely information to make decisions. Yet domain experts in healthcare, finance, law, and consulting still spend significant time manually reviewing reports, filings, and datasets to ensure completeness and compliance.  

These manual processes slow down analysis, increase inconsistency, and create compliance risks — especially in regulated sectors where traceability and validation are essential.
