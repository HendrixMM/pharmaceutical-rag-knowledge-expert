# Sensitive Patterns for BFG Repo-Cleaner
# Purpose: Replace known secret patterns in git history with ***REMOVED***
# Usage: bfg --replace-text scripts/sensitive-patterns.txt repo-mirror.git
# Notes:
# - Only include concrete leaked fingerprints discovered by the scanner
#   (e.g., truncated key prefixes like `nvapi-XXXXXXXX` or hashed IDs).
# - One pattern per line; case-sensitive by default.
# - Do NOT add generic tokens (e.g., `PUBMED_EUTILS_API_KEY=`) to avoid
#   erasing legitimate placeholders or documentation.
# - Generate fresh content with: bash scripts/identify_secrets_in_history.sh

# Discovered fingerprints will be appended here by the scanner.
