# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

This project is dedicated to advancing pharmaceutical research and clinical knowledge through responsible AI and RAG technologies. We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of scientific integrity, patient safety awareness, and evidence-based collaboration.

## Our Standards

### Positive Behaviors

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
- **Respecting medical and pharmaceutical expertise and professional qualifications**
- **Engaging in evidence-based discussions with proper citations**
- **Maintaining awareness of patient safety and clinical implications**
- **Collaborating with respect for regulatory and ethical considerations**

### Unacceptable Behaviors

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- **Providing medical advice or diagnosis (this project is for research and development, not clinical practice)**
- **Misrepresenting medical or scientific credentials**
- **Sharing unverified medical claims or misinformation**
- **Disregarding patient safety or regulatory compliance concerns**
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Domain-Specific Standards

Given the pharmaceutical and medical focus of this project:

1. **Evidence-Based Contributions**: All medical or pharmaceutical claims should be supported by credible sources (peer-reviewed literature, regulatory guidance, clinical guidelines)

2. **Patient Safety First**: Always consider patient safety implications when discussing features, bugs, or enhancements

3. **No Medical Advice**: This project is a research tool for RAG development and pharmaceutical information retrieval. It is NOT for providing medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment recommendations

4. **Respect for Expertise**: Recognize that pharmaceutical research involves specialized knowledge. Respect the expertise of domain experts while maintaining an inclusive environment for technical contributors

5. **Regulatory Awareness**: Be mindful of regulatory requirements (FDA, EMA, Health Canada, etc.) when discussing features or use cases

6. **Academic Integrity**: This project is affiliated with Concordia University research. All contributions should adhere to academic integrity standards (proper attribution, citation, no plagiarism)

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including but not limited to:

- GitHub repositories (issues, pull requests, discussions, code)
- Email communications related to the project
- Public presentations or representation of the project
- Academic conferences or events where the project is discussed
- Concordia University research contexts related to this project

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at **community@traycer.ai** (primary contact) or by creating a private GitHub issue with the `[CONDUCT]` label (alternative).

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

**Response Timeline**:

- **Initial acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Investigation and decision**: Within 72 hours for urgent matters, 1 week for non-urgent matters

### Confidentiality

All reports will be handled with discretion. We will not disclose the reporter's identity without explicit permission, except as required by law or institutional policy.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
