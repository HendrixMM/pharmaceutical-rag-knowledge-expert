# Verification Comments Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of all nine verification comments for the RAG Template for NVIDIA NemoRetriever project.

## Comment 1: Guardrails prompts include path likely incorrect

**Issue**: The prompts include path in `guardrails/config.yml` was incorrectly set to `guardrails/prompts.yml` instead of `prompts.yml`.

**Solution**: Updated the prompts include path from `guardrails/prompts.yml` to `prompts.yml` in `guardrails/config.yml`.

**Files Modified**:

- `guardrails/config.yml`

## Comment 2: Medical NLP/PII deps deviated from plan

**Issue**: Medical NLP/PII dependencies were added to `requirements-medical.txt` instead of `requirements.txt`, but there was no clear instruction about installing medical extras.

**Solution**: Added explicit comments in `requirements.txt` to instruct installing medical extras (`pip install -r requirements-medical.txt`) when medical guardrails are enabled.

**Files Modified**:

- `requirements.txt`

## Comment 3: SynthesisEngine bullet point clamping

**Issue**: SynthesisEngine did not properly clamp bullet points to 3-7 and did not handle low-evidence scenarios consistently.

**Solution**:

- Ensured bullet points are clamped between 3-7
- Added low-evidence fallback that yields at least 3 neutral bullets with appropriate caveats
- Improved consistency in handling low-evidence scenarios

**Files Modified**:

- `src/synthesis_engine.py`

## Comment 4: Guardrails flow/action wiring smoke test

**Issue**: No smoke test to assert flow/action wiring in guardrails.

**Solution**: Created a smoke test (`tests/test_guardrails_wiring.py`) that:

- Loads `guardrails/config.yml`
- Initializes the app
- Runs each flow with dummy inputs
- Asserts no runtime errors and expected keys in outputs

**Files Created**:

- `tests/test_guardrails_wiring.py`

## Comment 5: DDI/PK report formatting

**Issue**: DDI/PK report formatting did not ensure consistent units and percent/fold-change conventions.

**Solution**: Updated `_format_interaction_report` method to:

- Show normalized units next to each PK value
- Prefer % change with fold-change in parentheses when both present
- Append parsed p/CI when available

**Files Modified**:

- `src/ddi_pk_processor.py`

## Comment 6: MedicalGuardrails enable/disable knob

**Issue**: MedicalGuardrails did not expose an explicit enable/disable knob independent of environment variables.

**Solution**: Added an optional `enabled: Optional[bool] = None` parameter to `MedicalGuardrails.__init__`:

- If not None, use it to set the internal enabled flag
- Otherwise, fall back to the environment variable detection

**Files Modified**:

- `src/medical_guardrails.py`

## Comment 7: Configurable severity thresholds

**Issue**: Severity thresholds and keyword groups were not properly externally overridable.

**Solution**: Ensured thresholds and keyword groups are pulled from an instance-level `self.config` merged from defaults and the provided `config`, avoiding direct references to module constants in analysis methods.

**Files Modified**:

- `src/ddi_pk_processor.py`

## Comment 8: Colang flows action existence and error handling

**Issue**: Not all executed actions existed and error handling was inconsistent across flows.

**Solution**: Added to `guardrails/actions.py`:

- Minimal registry check for each exported action during `init()`
- Logging of missing registrations
- Catch-all error wrapper that returns a safe default payload for unregistered actions referenced by rails

**Files Modified**:

- `guardrails/actions.py`

## Comment 9: Citations formatting robustness

**Issue**: Citations formatting did not have robust fallback when both PMID and DOI are missing.

**Solution**:

- Added fallback citation template when both PMID and DOI are missing
- Used URL as alternative identifier when available
- Created unit tests covering missing title/authors/year/pmid/doi combinations

**Files Modified**:

- `src/synthesis_engine.py`
- `tests/test_citation_formatting.py` (new)

## Testing

All changes have been tested and verified:

- Existing test suite passes
- New guardrails wiring test passes
- New citation formatting test passes
- Manual verification of functionality

## Benefits

## These changes improve the robustness, reliability, and usability of the pharmaceutical analysis system by ensuring proper configuration, consistent formatting, comprehensive error handling, and reliable fallback mechanisms.
