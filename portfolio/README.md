# Portfolio Toolkit

This folder packages everything needed to present the project in a recruiter-friendly way.

## Contents

- `assets/` – drop screenshots, GIFs, and Loom thumbnails here. A `.gitkeep` placeholder keeps the folder in version control.
- `sample-data/` – curated prompts and expected insights to demonstrate business value on cue.
- `demo-scripts/` – talk tracks and walkthrough scripts for live or recorded demos.

## How to Use

1. **Skim the demo outline** in `demo-scripts/live_demo_outline.md` before an interview.
2. **Load the sample queries** into the app to reproduce pharma-relevant answers quickly.
3. **Capture visuals** following the recommendations in `assets/README.md` to build a highlights reel.

Bring this toolkit to every recruiter conversation to keep the discussion anchored on quantified impact.
