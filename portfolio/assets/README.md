# Visual Asset Plan

Use this checklist to capture visuals that reinforce business value:

1. **60-second product GIF** – show a question about drug interactions and the system surfacing ranked studies with safety callouts.
2. **Before/After metric slide** – visualize speed and cost savings using KPI deltas from `performance_validation_summary.md`.
3. **Workflow storyboard** – three static shots: intake question, automated PubMed enrichment, executive-ready answer.
4. **Compliance snapshot** – screenshot of citations plus the guardrails warning to highlight risk management.

Store exported files here so the README can link directly to recruiter-ready media.
