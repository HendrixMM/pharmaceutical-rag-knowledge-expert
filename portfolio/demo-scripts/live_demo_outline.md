# Live Demo Outline (5 minutes)

## 1. Hook (30 seconds)

- Introduce the business problem: teams drown in PubMed PDFs while preparing for launch and safety reviews.
- State the promise: this copilot answers regulatory-grade questions in seconds, not hours.

## 2. Scenario Setup (45 seconds)

- Persona: Pharmacovigilance manager checking azole antifungal interactions with rivaroxaban.
- Load the corresponding prompt from `../sample-data/sample_queries.csv`.

## 3. Demo Walkthrough (2 minutes)

1. Ask the question inside the web app or CLI.
2. Highlight live PubMed enrichment and study ranking as results stream in.
3. Point to the interaction alert, dosage extraction, and cited studies.
4. Show the cached response in `query_cache/` to reinforce compliance and audit readiness.

## 4. Business Proof (1 minute)

- Display KPI deltas: response time, cost per query, accuracy uplift (see README metrics section).
- Tie metrics back to headcount savings (e.g., "analyst hours reclaimed per week").

## 5. Close (45 seconds)

- Offer next step: share the Loom recap plus GitHub link for follow-up.
- Emphasize adaptability to oncology, vaccines, and payer dossiers.
